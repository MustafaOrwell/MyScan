MyScan - Modbus Scanner v1.0.1
Author: Mustafa AYDIN

1Ô∏è‚É£ Purpose and Scope
MyScan is a Modbus TCP client application designed for:

Industrial automation engineers

Protocol developers

Control system integration engineers

Educational purposes

It enables users to:

Connect to Modbus TCP devices

Read and write data from/to various Modbus register types

Perform continuous periodic data acquisition with stability

Analyze and decode raw Modbus data into multiple formats

The project is developed as a professional-grade engineering tool with a focus on scalability, modular architecture, and field usability.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Algorithmic Flow (Core Logic)
3.1 main.py ‚Äî User Interface Layer
3.1.1 PyQt5 Components Used
QMainWindow ‚Üí Application window

QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout ‚Üí Layout design

QLineEdit, QLabel, QComboBox ‚Üí User inputs

QPushButton ‚Üí Action triggers

QTableWidget ‚Üí Data display table

QTimer ‚Üí Periodic data acquisition

3.1.2 Primary Functions
Function	Role
toggle_connection()	Connect / Disconnect toggle
connect_to_modbus()	Establish Modbus TCP connection
read_data()	Perform single read
start_auto_read()	Start timer-based continuous reading
stop_auto_read()	Stop periodic reading safely
write_data()	Perform write operations (single/multiple)
decode_value()	Decode raw Modbus data to user-selected format

3.2 modbus_tcp.py ‚Äî Modbus Communication Layer
3.2.1 Core Functions
Function	Description
read_registers_by_type()	Read Holding, Input, Coil, Discrete
write_single_register()	Write single holding register
write_single_coil()	Write single coil (bit output)
write_multiple_registers()	Write multiple holding registers

3.2.2 Communication Logic
python
Copy
Edit
client = ModbusTcpClient(host=ip, port=port)
client.connect()
response = client.read_holding_registers(address=address, count=count, slave=unit_id)
client.close()
4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Parsing and Decoding Logic
4.1 Register Type Mapping
Register Type	Modbus Command Used
Holding	read_holding_registers()
Input	read_input_registers()
Coil	read_coils()
Discrete	read_discrete_inputs()

4.2 Data Type Decoding Logic
DataType	Parsing Algorithm
Int	16-bit signed integer
UInt	16-bit unsigned integer
Hex	Hexadecimal display
Binary	Binary format
ASCII	Single byte ASCII character
Float	2 words (32-bit IEEE 754 float), Little Endian
Double	4 words (64-bit IEEE 754 double), Big Endian

Example (Float Parsing):
python
Copy
Edit
b = struct.pack('<HH', data[index], data[index + 1])
float_value = struct.unpack('<f', b)[0]
Example (Double Parsing):
python
Copy
Edit
b = struct.pack('>HHHH', data[index], data[index+1], data[index+2], data[index+3])
double_value = struct.unpack('>d', b)[0]
5Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling and Stability
All communication is wrapped with try-except error handling blocks.

Every read/write operation checks connection validity before proceeding.

The auto-read timer is safely stopped upon any connection or protocol failure.

Disconnect operation automatically cancels ongoing read cycles for full stability.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Engineering Design Principles
Modular Architecture: GUI and protocol layers are completely separated.

Minimal Dependency: Only pymodbus and PyQt5 are required.

Stable Runtime: Automatic recovery from communication failures.

Clean Code: Clear function separation and naming.

Protocol Compliance: Strict adherence to Modbus TCP standards.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Future Planned Enhancements (Next Versions)
In upcoming professional versions, following features are targeted to be implemented:

üîß Connection Management
IP address history: Store previously connected IP addresses.

Dropdown selector for saved connections.

üîß UI Enhancement
Address & Quantity inputs will allow multi-column read instead of simple list view.

More advanced visualization of bit-level data:

When reading Coils ‚Üí display per-bit states directly.

When selecting Binary ‚Üí display entire register as individual bits.

üîß Execution Mode
Full packaging into a standalone Windows/Linux executable (.exe/.app) via PyInstaller.

üîß Professional Grade Features
Logging system for communication monitoring.

Export/Import of read data (CSV, JSON support).

Word Swap / Endian toggle selection directly from GUI.

Real-time live data chart visualization.

Goal:
MyScan will gradually evolve into a full-featured, professional-grade, field-usable Modbus diagnostic and testing tool suitable for real-world industrial deployment.

10Ô∏è‚É£ Summary Logic Flow
User provides input parameters.

Modbus TCP connection is established.

Read/Write operations are executed via modbus_tcp.py.

Data is decoded into appropriate formats.

Results are displayed in real-time table view.

System maintains full runtime safety on connection loss or protocol exceptions.

‚ö† Engineering Note
This project is intentionally designed as an educational and scalable industrial communication client platform.
The codebase, architecture, and algorithms are directly applicable to real-world SCADA, PLC, and automation test systems.
